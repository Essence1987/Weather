# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard was created using Third-Party APIs. It shows the 5 day forecast and current weather based off user input. Upon first loading the site the user can turn on geo-location. Upon doing so it will give them the approximate weather forecast for their area. The search history is stored localy and up to the last 8 can be clicked on to re-search the selected cities. 

## Visuals

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

The following <a href="https://essence1987.github.io/Weather/">link</a> takes you to the live page 

**Note** This mockup may not fully match the current page's functionality.

## Project status
I am still having trouble with the error message displaying if a user enters a City which does not exist. In a future update this issue will be corrected.
